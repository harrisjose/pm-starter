# Styling nodes with Marks

In HTML, a paragraph with markup is represented as a tree, like this:

```html
<p>
  This is <strong>strong text with <em>emphasis</em></strong>
</p>
```

In ProseMirror, the inline content is modeled as a flat sequence, with the markup attached as metadata to the nodes. This is typically done in the form of `Marks`. A mark is a piece of information that can be attached to a node, such as it being emphasized, in code font, or a link.

We can define marks in the schema the same way we define nodes. Let's take a look at a simple mark that applies the `strong` tag around a piece of text:

```js
marks: {
  strong: {
    parseDOM: [
      { tag: "strong" },
    ],
    toDOM() { return ["strong", 0]; }
  },
}
```

An easy way to apply this mark on a piece of text is to use the toggleMark helper from `prosemirror-commands`. Take a look at the sandbox below to see how it works. You can also try defining your own mark from the example.

<Sandpack
  template="react"
  theme="dark"
  className="not-prose"
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      "@nytimes/react-prosemirror": "0.2.3",
      "prosemirror-commands": "1.5.2",
      "prosemirror-dropcursor": "1.8.1",
      "prosemirror-keymap": "1.2.2",
      "prosemirror-schema-basic": "1.2.2",
    },
  }}
  files={{
    "/App.js": appContent,
    "/footer.js": footerContent,
    "/schema.js": schemaContent,
    "/styles.css": stylesContent,
  }}
  options={{
    visibleFiles: ["/footer.js", "/schema.js"],
    activeFile: "/footer.js",
    editorHeight: 500,
    autoReload: true,
    showLineNumbers: true,
  }}
/>

You can do a lot more with marks like adding attributes to it, defining which nodes can contain marks etc. Take a look at the official docs for more examples.

If you just need a way to change how the view renders content without actually changing/adding anything to the document, you can use [decorations](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#view.decorations) instead.
