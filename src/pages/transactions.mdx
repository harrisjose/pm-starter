# Transactions & Commands üïäÔ∏è

Let's look at a practical example of using transactions to change something in our editor. We'll be adding a node to the editor in response to the user clicking a button.

As we've learnt before transactions that describe changes to the document contain a series of steps. Usually these steps are generated for you when you use methods in the transaction.

You can create a new transaction using `view.state.tr` and dispatch it using `view.dispatch(tr)`

<div className="callout">
  Note that `view` here is an instance of
  [`prosemirror-view`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#view) which holds the
  current EditorState, handles rendering the EditorState and responding to user
  input. You don't need to know in detail about this just yet but knowing about
  the view is essential when you build text-editors.
</div>

Let's take a look at the `insert` method:

```js
tr.insert(position, Node.fromJSON(schema, { type: "paragraph" }));
```

<div className="callout">
  `tr.insert` take a node and inserts it to a specified position in the
  document. `Node.fromJSON` is a helper function we can use to create an
  instance of the node from its JSON representation.
</div>

Here's an example that does all of this:

<Sandpack
  template="react"
  theme="dark"
  className="not-prose"
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      "@nytimes/react-prosemirror": "0.2.3",
      "prosemirror-commands": "1.5.2",
      "prosemirror-dropcursor": "1.8.1",
      "prosemirror-keymap": "1.2.2",
      "prosemirror-schema-basic": "1.2.2",
    },
  }}
  files={{
    "/App.js": appContent,
    "/footer.js": footerContent,
    "/schema.js": { code: schemaContent },
    "/styles.css": stylesContent,
  }}
  options={{
    visibleFiles: ["/footer.js", "/schema.js", "/App.js"],
    activeFile: "/footer.js",
    editorHeight: 500,
    autoReload: true,
    showLineNumbers: true,
  }}
/>

<Spacer space={10} />

Transactions are not just for CRUD operations. They are also used to set the
selection, move the current cursor position among other operations. Let's look
at an example:

In the previous sandbox try adding in the following code at `line 22`

```js
tr.setSelection(
  new TextSelection(
    tr.doc.resolve(newPos + node.nodeSize),
    tr.doc.resolve(newPos)
  )
);
```

Click on the reload button once and then try adding the node again. The code we added now creates a new text selection that selects the newly created node.

### Abstracting actions into commands

In ProseMirror, a command is a function that implements an editing action (like adding a node to the document), which the user can perform by pressing some key combination or interacting with the menu.

Commands have certain rules but are essentially a function that takes the state and a dispatch function and returns a boolean. Typically the function executes transactions on the state it was passed and dispatches them.

Let's take a look at an example:

```js
function deleteSelection(state, dispatch) {
  if (state.selection.empty) return false;
  if (dispatch) dispatch(state.tr.deleteSelection());
  return true;
}
```

The above command deletes the current selection if there is one and then returns true. The `prosemirror-commands` module provides a number of editing commands. There is also an utility function `chainCommands` that can be used to combine a number of commands ‚Äî they will be tried one after the other until one return true.

We'll look at complex commands when we work with `Marks` but here is a simple example that you can play around with:

<Sandpack
  template="react"
  theme="dark"
  className="not-prose"
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      "@nytimes/react-prosemirror": "0.2.3",
      "prosemirror-commands": "1.5.2",
      "prosemirror-dropcursor": "1.8.1",
      "prosemirror-keymap": "1.2.2",
      "prosemirror-schema-basic": "1.2.2",
    },
  }}
  files={{
    "/App.js": appContent,
    "/footer.js": footerContent2,
    "/schema.js": { code: schemaContent },
    "/styles.css": stylesContent,
  }}
  options={{
    visibleFiles: ["/footer.js", "/schema.js", "/App.js"],
    activeFile: "/footer.js",
    editorHeight: 500,
    autoReload: true,
    showLineNumbers: true,
  }}
/>
