# State and Transactions ðŸ¥ž

In ProseMirror, the **EditorState** represents the complete state of the editor, including the document, selection, and various config options. Consider it to be a snapshot of the editor's state at a specific moment.

Let's take a look at how we can use the **EditorState** along with the schema we built previously.

<Sandpack
  template="react"
  theme="dark"
  className="not-prose"
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      "@nytimes/react-prosemirror": "0.2.3",
      "prosemirror-commands": "1.5.2",
      "prosemirror-dropcursor": "1.8.1",
      "prosemirror-keymap": "1.2.2",
      "prosemirror-schema-basic": "1.2.2",
    },
  }}
  files={{
    "/App.js": appContent,
    "/footer.js": footerContent,
    "/schema.js": { code: schemaContent, readOnly: true },
    "/styles.css": stylesContent,
  }}
  options={{
    visibleFiles: ["/App.js", "/schema.js"],
    activeFile: "/App.js",
    editorHeight: 500,
    autoReload: true,
    showLineNumbers: true,
  }}
/>

In **line 10-12** we initialize an editor state using our previously defined schema. We also create an intial **doc** from JSON using the `schema.nodeFromJSON` method (in ./schema.js).

The **EditorState** has other properties like `Selection` and `Plugins` but we'll look at those later. For now, this is all that's required to get ProseMirror render our document in the editor.

### What are Transactions?

Coming back to the code, in **line 14-20** we've got a dispatch function that accepts a `Transaction` and applies it to the existing state to produce a new state (**EditorState** is immutable).

**Transactions** (or more accurately [Transforms](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#transform)) are how prosemirror manages changes. Any changes to the selection, document are all expressed via **Transactions** that are applied on the current state to produce a newer version of the state.

Transactions can consist of a series of **Steps** that describe changes to the document. Try loggin the `tr` in the sandbox and inspect it in your browser console to see what Steps look like.
