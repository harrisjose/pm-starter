# Defining the Schema üç±

ProseMirror requires you to specify a schema that your document conforms to always. The schema is then used to create a state which will generate the document. We'll cover in future sections so let's focus on the **schema** for now.

The schema describes the kind of nodes that may occur in the document, and the way they are nested. For example, we might say that the top-level node can contain one or more paragraph nodes, and that paragraph nodes can contain text.

Here's how we can express that as code:

<Sandpack
  template="react"
  theme="dark"
  className="not-prose"
  customSetup={{
    dependencies: {
      "@nytimes/react-prosemirror": "0.2.3",
      "prosemirror-commands": "1.5.2",
      "prosemirror-dropcursor": "1.8.1",
      "prosemirror-keymap": "1.2.2",
      "prosemirror-schema-basic": "1.2.2",
    },
  }}
  files={{
    "/App.js": appContent,
    "/schema.js": { code: schemaContent, readOnly: true },
    "/styles.css": stylesContent,
  }}
  options={{
    visibleFiles: ["/schema.js"],
    activeFile: "/schema.js",
  }}
/>

<div className="callout">
  Note that keys like 'enter' don't work just yet since Prosemirror doesn't
  handle them by default. We'll be implementing them via plugins which are
  covered later.
</div>

Let's try to understand what's going on here better. First up is the document node:

```
doc: { content: "block+" },
```

We've specified here that the `doc` node must contain at least one `block` node as it's content. `block` here can either mean a group or a node.

Next is the paragraph node.

```
paragraph: {
  group: "block",
  content: "inline*",
}
```

Here we've specified that the paragraph node belongs to the `block` group and can contain any number of nodes from the `inline` group as it's content.

<Spacer space={10} />
